# Caps Lock Macros
## Motivation / Features
Using the Caps Lock key as shortcut in computer games under stock Windows is annoying. You never know if it's on or off without looking down at your keyboard or typing some test text.

This leads to the first functionality of the program: it disables the Caps Lock functionality.

But why not use the Caps Lock key as an macro key then? This is the main functionality of the program.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 64 bit
- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) x64 runtime

## Installation

Of course, you don't want to manually import the printed file every time. This application can be run from command-line with a file specified:

```bash
Better-Printing-for-OneNote.exe <path to file>
```
